        | Hello everyone and welcome to my Naked and Afraid Fan website! My name is Brad, and I'm a huge Naked and Afraid fan.

      p.text-muted
        | When I first heard about the show, I shrugged it off. I've always watched Survival shows, but I just assumed that Naked and Afraid couldn't possibly be authentic. How could they cram 21 days of real survival stuff into a single episode? No way.

      p.text-muted
        | Then came the COVID lockdowns. I came across Naked and Afraid XL and fell in love. Boy, was I wrong. Since then, it's been a non stop Naked and Afraid ride for me.

      p.text-muted
        | I started wondering stuff like, how many people have brought a fire starter? How many epsiodes have there been when they didn't have a pot? Stuff like that. What items has Laura Zerra brought on her challenges? Just how many challenges has Matt Wright done?

      p.text-muted
        | All those kinds of questions led me here, to this point. I couldn't find a good source on the internet to answer my questions. So I decided to build a website to answer those questions. And here we are.

      p.text-muted
        | I didn't rely on other websites or other people's work to gather the data for this website. I gathered it myself, straight from the show.

      p.text-muted
        | But I'm not done yet - one of the burning questions - who has the most days on Naked and Afraid? Or - Who has killed big game? There's more questions to answer.

      p.text-muted
        | I'd also like to use this site as a way to promote the Survivalists. Their books, podcasts, survival training, knives, and more.

      p.text-muted.mb-0
        | So stay tuned to the website, I'll be adding more answers over time! Please use the contact form if you find any errors or have any questions, thank you for visiting!
